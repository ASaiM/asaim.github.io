# ASaiM
Metatranscriptomic data allow active microbial communities description by gene products analysis. In comparison to metagenomic studies, few metatranscriptomic data have been obtained on  environmental ecosystems (soil, water, mine drainage…) as on human-associated microbiota despite health concerns. This discrepancy is due to difficulties in RNA recovery but also to a lack of tools dedicated to metatranscriptomic data processing. Nevertheless, some homemade pipelines adapted from metagenomics analyses exist but are not freely available and thus not easily accessible.

_Auvergne Sequence Analysis of Intestinal Microbiota_ (ASaiM) is a pipeline to process metatranscriptomic data from intestinal microbiota. Starting from raw reads, it generates taxonomic and functional assignments using databases dedicated to this microbiome. These gut databases become more and more supplied by large metagenomic projects (like _MetaHIT_ and _HMP_ projects for microbial reference genomes) and therefore useful for reliable and accurate assignments. Finally, ASaiM combines taxonomic, functional and abundance information, coupled to statistical analyses and data mining tools. This pipeline is designed to be adjustable (personalized or proposed data processing given the type of data) and intuitive with its web interface, documentation and tutorials
