## _**A**uvergne **S**equence **A**nalysis of **I**ntestinal **M**icrobiota (ASaiM)_

ASaiM is an **environment to analyze metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequences
from intestinal microbiota**. The environment is constituted of:

- An **expert database** combining data on intestinal microbiota.
<br>_Note: This database is currently under construction_

- A **web interface** to query the database
<br>_Note: This database is currently under construction_

- A **framework** to process and analyze intestinal microbiota from raw sequences
  to taxonomic and functional assignations. This framework generates workflows 
  with numerous different tools that can then be executed in the ASaiM environment. 
  Our goal is to provide a solution that is:
    - easy to use for everyone, from beginners to experts
    - adjustable, with numerous supported and proposed tools
