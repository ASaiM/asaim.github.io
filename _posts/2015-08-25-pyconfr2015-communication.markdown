comm_title: "ASaiM: Lessons learned from developing a framework for biologists"
comm_summary: "With new technologies and reduced costs of DNA sequencing, biological data are massively generated. Such data are complex and require multi-step processing. While numerous tools exist, most of them are only performing one task, not interoperable, not user-friendly, and so on... That is a big deal for biologists!

We are building ASaiM (Auvergne Sequence Analysis of Intestinal Microbiota), a framework to process and analyze data from intestinal microbiota, designed for biologists: simple yet powerful!

In this talk, I am going to introduce how we created ASaiM, why we chose Python, but also what I have learnt developing such a software."
