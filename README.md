# The Website!

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ASaiM/asaim.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ASaiM/asaim.github.io)

ASaiM is an environment to analyze metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequences
from intestinal microbiota. The environment is constituted of:

- An expert database combining information from analysis of intestinal
microbiota.
<br>_Note: This database is currently under construction_

- A framework to process and analyze intestinal microbiota from raw sequences
  to taxonomic and functional assignations. This framework makes the connection
  between different tools and then generates pipelines that can then be executed
  in the ASaiM environment. Our goal is to provide a solution that is:
    - easy to use for everyone, from beginners to experts
    - adjustable, with numerous supported and proposed tools
