# The Website!

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ASaiM/asaim.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ASaiM/asaim.github.io)

_Auvergne Sequence Analysis of Intestinal Microbiota_ (ASaiM) is a pipeline to
process metatranscriptomic data from intestinal microbiota. Starting from raw
reads, it generates taxonomic and functional assignments using databases
dedicated to this microbiome. These gut databases become more and more supplied
by large metagenomic projects (like _MetaHIT_ and _HMP_ projects for microbial
reference genomes) and therefore useful for reliable and accurate assignments.
Finally, ASaiM combines taxonomic, functional and abundance information, coupled
to statistical analyses and data mining tools. This pipeline is designed to be
adjustable (personalized or proposed data processing given the type of data) and
intuitive with its web interface, documentation and tutorials

# Getting Started

This website is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com):

    $ git clone git@github.com:ASaiM/asaim.github.io.git
    $ cd asaim.github.io
    $ jekyll serve

Then, browse [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).
